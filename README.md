# WebScraping-AmazonPage

Please note: After project completion, it seems that Amazon does not allow the request to parse the data (a Captcha prompt has been implemented). As a work-around and to complete the project within reasonable bounds, I have commented the commands that would be used if this was not the case, and have hard coded the data for the sake of appending it to the .csv file.
